# Alex's Red Beans and Rice

Here's my version of Jay's red beans and rice recipe. It helps to do most of the prep the night before, then spend the cooktime cleaning or doing laundry.

## Cookware 

- large metal pot with a lid (aim for somthing about 12"x10" or ~5 gallons)
- large rice cooker or big pot to do it on the stove. I can do at least 6 cups of rice per batch in my 6 quart instant pot.
- A large container to carry all the warm rice 
- sharp knife, some scissors for the celery if desired
- cutting board

## Ingredients

- 5 lbs dry red beans
- 5 lb rice
- 4 yellow or sweet
- ~ 1 gal water, can sub broth
- 1 bundle of celery stalks
- 1-2 heads of garlic
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 26oz can of cream of mushroom soup
- a few bay leaves
- 8 tbsp parsley
- seasonings to taste

## Steps

Give the onions and celery a rough chop. Feel free to use scissors for the celery. I don't bother chopping the garlic, I just crush it, nobody can tell.Put them in a container and keep them in the fridge overnight.

Soak the beans overnight in the large pot, covered. Be sure to add enough water (at least a few inches over the beans).

In the morning, drain the beans and keep them in another container to the side.

In the large pot, on low heat, sauté the onions, celery, and garlic in the olive oil until the onions are translucent.

Add the beans, water or broth, and spices. Mix, cover, bring to boil. Add the can of cream of mushroom soup. Rinse it into the pot if you need extra liquid, then crush the can.

Simmer covered for 3-4 hours, stirring and scraping the bottom every 20 minutes or so.

Around two hours before you need to leave, start making the rice. I do two big batches of rice in my 6qt instant pot. I have successfully done 6cups to a batch, and I think you could probably get away with a little more. 

## Serving tips:

The typical serving size for the rice is ½  cup.  The typical serving size for the beans is a ladle full, which is maybe ¾ cup or a bit more. We almost always run out of rice first. When you transport the pot(s) in your car, secure the lid with masking tape so it doesn’t fall off.

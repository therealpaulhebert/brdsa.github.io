# Pinto beans

## Ingredients 

- 1 lb dried pinto beans
- olive oil
- 1 white or yellow onion chopped
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper
- 1 tsp Tony's Cajun seasoning
- 1 tsp Liquid Smoke
- 2 h tsp chicken bouillon granules
- 5 cups water

## Steps

Soak beans overnight covered. Beans should be placed in large pot and water added
to at least 2 or 3 inches above the beans.

Drain beans. Put about couple of tablespoons of olive oil in Dutch oven. Saute
chopped onion and minced garlic until onion is clear and soft. 

Add beans and all other ingredients - salt , pepper, Tonys, liquid smoke, water, and bouillon.
Cover and cook on medium until starts to boil then reduce heat to maintain simmer.

Cook for approximately 3 hours until beans are soft. Stir at least every 20 or 30
minutes and reduce heat if beans start sticking to the bottom of the pot. Serve over
cooked rice.

For downtown crowd, cook 8 lbs of beans and increase all ingredients 8 times. Use
two big soup pots with 4 lbs in each pot. When finished cooking, transfer contents
of small soup pot into large soup pot.

_Editor's note: crushing the beans against the pot makes for a creamier texture._

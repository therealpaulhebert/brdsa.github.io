# Chicken Sandwiches and Potato Casserole 

Makes ~ 50 sandwiches, and about as many portions of the potato salad (two casserole pans).

## Ingredients
### Sandwiches
- 1 container chicken broth 
- 10-12 chicken breasts
- 4 small yellow onions
- 1 bunch celery 
- 4-6 cans of cream of chicken soup 
- 50 hamburger buns 

### Casserole
- 1 stick butter 
- 2 pints sour cream 
- 4 cans cream of chicken soup 
- 4 cups shredded cheddar cheese 
- 2 2 lb bags of frozen hash browns

## Steps

### Sandwiches

Can be made with instant pot or crockpot. Put 1 container of chicken broth in the instant/crockpot. Add 10-12 chicken breasts. Chop 4 small onions and 1 bunch of celery. Add to the pot. Cook until tender. (Instant pot: cook for 20 mins on high pressure and release pressure immediately after cooking.) Remove chicken and shred with forks. Spoon out the celery and onion and drain. Dump out liquid from pot. Put everything back into the pot. Add 4-6 cans of cream of chicken soup. Stir together. Cook on low until heated through.

### Casserole 

Mix in a large bowl, 1 stick of melted butter, 2 pints sour cream, 4 cans cream of chicken soup, 4 cups shredded cheddar cheese. Add two 2-pound bags of frozen hash browns and mix well. Place in 13x9 inch greased baking dish. Bake at 350F for 45 minutes. It usually takes a little longer than 45 minutes. Take it out and try a potato. Should be firm and not mushy.

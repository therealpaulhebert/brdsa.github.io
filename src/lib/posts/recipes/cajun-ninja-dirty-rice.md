## Ingredients

- 3 Yellow Onion
- 3 Green Bell Pepper
- 6 Sticks of Celery
- 3 Bunch Green Onion
- 12 Cloves of Garlic
- 2 Tablespoon of Vegetable Oil
- 2.5 lb Ground Chuck
- 2.5 lb Ground Pork Spicy Breakfast Sausage
- 3 Teaspoon of Salt to season meat
- 2.5 Stick of Butter
- 10 cups of Chicken Stock (this needs 3x 32 oz containers of chicken stock, you'll have half a container left over)
- 3 Tablespoon of Cajun/Creole Seasoning
- 2.5 Tablespoon of Browning Sauce
- 8-3/4 Cups of Water
- 5 Beef Bouillon Cubes
- 10 Cups of Rice

## Steps

Start out by heating a large pot over a medium/low heat.
Chop the onion, bell pepper, celery, green onion, and garlic. Move the chop vegetables off to the side for now.

Add a Tablespoon of vegetable oil to the pot.
Drop the ground chuck and spicy ground pork sausage into the pot.
Blend the meat together then add a teaspoon of salt.
Once all the meat has become brown and crumbly, pour into a strainer over a plate of paper towels, and let it sit for now.

At this time preheat your oven to 300°.
Drop in one stick of butter into the large pot.
Once the butter has melted, add the chopped vegetables to the pot.
Cook down the vegetables for 25-30 minutes.
After 25-30 minutes add the meat back to the pot.

Next add the chicken stock.
After you’ve blended in the stock, add the cajun seasoning, browning sauce, water, and bouillon cubes.
Raise the heat to a high heat so that you can reach a boil.
At this time add the rice and mix well.
Once you’ve reached a boil, cover, turn the heat off, and place the pot in the oven.

After the one hour mark, remove the pot from the oven, and let sit for 5 minutes before uncovering it.
After five minutes, uncover, stir, serve, and enjoy!

# Plain Vegan Rice

This is just a plain oven baked rice recipe to use alongside the red beans recipe if you don’t have a rice cooker but you do have an oven-safe pot.

The key with all rice recipes is sticking to the water:rice ratio.

## Ingredients

I use a 17.75"L x 11"W x 9"H Magnalite pot with lid and everything fits.

- 3.5 lbs/10 rice cooker cups of extra-long-grain enriched rice
- 14 cups of water
- 2 stick of vegan butter
- 2.5 tbsp of coarse kosher salt

## Steps

1. Preheat over to 350F
2. Mix water, salt, and seasoning in large magnalite pot with lid. Put on high heat burner
3. While heating up water, cut up butter stick and add to water. Mix around until fully melted.
4. Stir water occasionally until a full boil begins
5. Stir one final time to get the water and oil mixed, then pour in rice and continue to stir occasionally.
6. Return to boil, give final stir and put in oven. Check at 45 minutes for free water at bottom and doneness at top
7. Remove by 1 hour. Let steam vent out of pot for several minutes and then fluff.
